    <p>I started the day with an interesting cabbage and sausage dish. It was simple, greasy, and ohhh so delicious. I couldn't stand the instant coffee at first, but I'm almost embarrassed to say it's been growing on me.</p>
<p>We had a lecture from a professor named Godfrey. He gave us a breakdown of the mobile market in Ghana and explained how the government is involved with the "invisible hand" in this country. It's a free market economy, but the government seems to favor local providers being the major supplier of mobile phone cards--and the government will pass laws to make it so. Speaking of which, there is a major court case that is going to receive a verdict this Thursday. The US Embassy is warning there might be riots and we might be evacuated. However, all of the program coordinators and political science professors I've interacted with don't think it will come to that and assure me that there is no need to be worried.</p>
<p>
The Twi lesson today was very interesting. I was given an African name: Kwabana. Since that name is kind of a mouthful, they gave me the nickname, "nanaki." This roughly translates to "King Tuesday." Tuesday because that was the day I was born. Ghanaians refer to each other by the day they were born! The culture is very much a "drop-in" culture. Our teacher was talking about how she drops-in on her friends all of the time. Everybody here seems to be very religious. I've been invited to church several times and I think I am going to go (there doesn't seem to be any escaping it). People have been finding my philosophical insights on life very interesting--it seems to be a way of thinking most Ghanaian haven't been exposed to.</p>
<p>I bought plantain chips on the road. These are pretty good. They're dirt cheap too. Literally less than 50 cents USD. I bought a bag of water for 25 cents USD. I've spent less than $2 USD on all three of my meals today. And everything has been delicious.</p>

<p>I also took a tour of Accra today. I learned about the first president and he was definitely an interesting guy. He married an Egyptian woman although it wouldn't be healthy for him to do so in a local political sense (although it would be very healthy from a foreign relations sense). He did his undergraduate work at Lincoln University, his masters at UPenn, and his PhD at the London School of Economics. He was eventually overthrown because of the revolutionary company of friends he'd keep. I would have flipped through his thesis, but it was protected under glass. He'd hang out with everyone from Muhammad Ali to Nehru to Castro to Mao.</p>

<p>I finally tried Waakye for lunch. It was basically a type of spicy meat (chicken or fish) served with rice and black-eyed peas. I have a lot more food to try! I went to a night market close to the university. I ended up getting dinner to-go and they basically just thrown all of the food you order into a plastic bag (which you then eat with your hands). All in all it's been a pretty interesting day.</p>
<p>Gerald has gone AWOL. I hope he wasn't kidnapped by any of the hotel attendants. He was really growing on me. Who knows-- he may turn up tomorrow morning.</p>
