<div><span>Over the last week, I had to investigate, prepare, and present an important scientific study, as well as write a final paper for a class I was taking. Needless to say, it was not easy to remain stress free. I may have appeared calm and collected on the outside, but on the inside I was a total train wreck. It is a well documented fact that stress can be a killerâ€”so cutting as much out as possible is definitely something worth striving for.</span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Productivity and stress don't really have much to do with each other. They may be correlated in some ways, but for the most part they are independent.  </span></div>
<div><span>It is possible to be:</span></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>productive and not stressed   </span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>stressed and not productive</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>unproductive and unstressed</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>productive and stressed.</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>I've found that there are 3 factors that contribute to making a task stressful:</span></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>poor planning</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>unreasonable expectations</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>poor time management</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>When there is no plan, there really isn't any course of action to follow. Setting up a plan for action is essential. This will ensure a smooth flow of events when completing task milestones. There shouldn't be any moment when a milestone is complete and one is left to wonder about what to do next.</span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Being ambitious is one thing, setting high standards is another, but setting unreachable goals is just a waste of time and energy. Not only is this demotivating, but it is something that will never get finished. Nobody likes to fail, so why setup for failure? Ultimately, it does more harm than good.</span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Taking long breaks is completely understandable. In fact, I encourage it! A fresh mind is a more productive mind. However, there is a point where it is necessary to buckle down and churn out some machine-like work. Human beings are very capable of working on a single task for a few hours straight. Besides taking it easy on the breaks, it is crucial to spend time on the right parts of the task! Remember the 80/20 rule. 20% of the work takes 80% of the time, 80% of the work takes 20% of the time. Get that 80% done. Finish the easy tasks first and then go for the gold.</span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>In retrospect, I'm sure that if I had followed my own advice I wouldn't have been so stressed out. Hopefully, anybody else who reads this takes away something useful.</span></div>
