<p>I don't think I know even one person who deals with less than 100 emails a day anymore. I've found these two personal rules to be invaluable in making my email communication concise and efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Keep It Short</strong></p>
<p>Email is best used as a short message communication medium. Longer emails tend to get tucked away for "when I have time." It's better to have a back and forth through email than it is to write a novel that is never read. We may be able to type faster than we can write, but we can talk even faster than we can type.</p>
<p><strong>Be Assertive</strong></p>
<p>If you are trying to schedule a meeting with someone, please don't be annoyingly polite and write things like "I was wondering if..." Just schedule a meeting. Instead say, "I'd like to meet. How does Tuesday work?" This will get a conversation going about meeting. If they aren't interested in meeting, they will let you know in some way (e.g. weaseling out of it and not suggesting an alternative date)!</p>
<p>Conversational etiquette is very different from email etiquette. When you send an email with an invitation or meeting suggestion, more politeness equals more words equals more words for people to read equals more pain for everyone. People know email can't communicate subtleties in conversation like vocal inflections, facial expressions, or body language. Don't be afraid to be terse!</p>
