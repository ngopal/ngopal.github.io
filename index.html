<h1>Hello. I'm Nikhil.</h1>

<p markdown=1>
Welcome to my web page, where I sporadically post a number of loosely related items.

If you are here looking for course materials, you may be interested in the course materials from the <a href="http://nikhilgopal.com/bime591">Biomedical Visualization</a> class I co-taught at University of Washington in Winter 2016, or perhaps the (very introductory) online course on <a href="http://bit.ly/d3coffeescript">Coffeescript and D3</a> offered through Oâ€™Reilly Media.

If you are here looking for information about my research, it is likely best to just send me an email or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nikhilgopal">tweet</a>. You may find what you are looking for  by searching through my <a href="http://www.github.com/ngopal">github repositories</a>. A list of publications, talks, etc. may be found on this <a href="http://nikhilgopal.com/publications.html">page</a>.

If you are here searching for archived blog posts (which are now extremely dated and likely irrelevant), those may be found <a href="http://nikhilgopal.com/posts.html">here</a>.

</p>

Thanks!
