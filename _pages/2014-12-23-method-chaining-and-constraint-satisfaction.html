<p>Two programming concepts that have helped me write code in a better way.</p>
<p>In the same way that people design UIs for users, I like to design code for those who will be using the code library. This is different from *.</p>
<p><strong>Method Chaining:</strong></p>
<p>Code should read like a sentence. Network libraries look ugly in R and Python.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<p>I like to explicitly set some constraints. Constraints, in the AI sense of the word, are requirements and preferences. Constraint propagation methods have been used to solve interesting programming problems like Sudoku.</p>
<p><strong>Other General Tips:</strong></p>
<p>Use matrices and write code to expect and employ matrix operations. Obviously, this doesn't universally apply to every problem and situation, but I've found this to be a good rule of thumb in the world of research. R's apply is like Javascript's map.</p>
<p>Avoid if-statements whenever possible. This annoys some people. Again, use your best judgement.</p>
