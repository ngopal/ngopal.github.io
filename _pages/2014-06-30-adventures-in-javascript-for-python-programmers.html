<p>A guide for python programmers to transition into javascript:</p>
<p>About the author: PhD student @ UW. Great at Python, but need JS for dissertation. Wrote this up to help others in same boat. pic of me.</p>
<p>This is meant to be concise, but useful.</p>
<p>Benefits of learning JS as a Python programmer: better programmer, web is a new realm, new libs. Viz networks, cytoscape js, nothing in Python... Downsides though...<br />
Fundamental Differences: asynchronous, community demographics (I'm a scientist)<br />
Objects, Declarations, and Syntax<br />
Differences in Logic and Flow Control<br />
Coffeescript: Easy...and hard<br />
Classes, Functions, and Design Patterns: typical design patterns used in python still work, but...a few for you to learn like currying, memoization.<br />
Map-Reduce-Filter<br />
Web Frameworks: Python-Django/flask, etc. JS--don't even ask...<br />
Packaging Code, Bower, Grunt</p>

<p>Typical program takes a while to write anyway. May as well do it right and make it useful. for everything else we have bash, awk, and sed! In bioinformatics, I use a combination of those three for pretty much everything. Python is great for my own terminal implementations, R is great for using other scientific libraries and stats, but JS is great for everything else. with Python changing to Python 3, you may as well refactor your code into another language and learn it.</p>
