<p>Knowledge from: A fast agglomerative community detection method for protein complex discovery in protein interaction networks by M Rahman et al.</p>
<p>Modules = dense sub-graphs </p>
<p>Three classes of module detection:<br />
1. finding cliques (clique = fully connected sub-network)<br />
2. finding subnetworks (not necessarily cliques)<br />
3. uncovering hierarchical organizations within a network.</p>
<p>The state of community finding currently mis-classifies proteins or are ignored due to low topological connectivity.</p>
<p>Community finding is best when the data matrix is sparse. Otherwise, we are clustering.</p>
<p>Girvan and Newman computes edge-betweenness centrality value (= how many shortest paths travel through this edge) of each edge. They are sorted and edges with large betweenness values are removed in an iterative manner to detect communities.</p>
<p>So, a community is basically a subnetwork with more connections between in-network nodes than out-network.</p>
