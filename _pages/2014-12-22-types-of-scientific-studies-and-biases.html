<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It's difficult to completely articulate the mental process I step through when trying to understand an experiment. Sometimes one factor outweighs another, and through years of experience I pay more attention to whichever one I instinctively decide is more dire to point out or address. However, I believe I can provide a lightweight mental framework for you to start stepping through the same mental process I go through myself when trying to understand the possible biases in a scientific study. It's not possible to eliminate bias completely, but it is possible to understand that there are biases, and it's important to acknowledge them.</p>
<p>I know when I read a paper that there is a lot of science that has happened behind the scenes that I will never know about. Research is not a linear process, although a paper must be presented linearly. I also know that a lot of my mental model for what to call hypocrisy or call attention to is derived anecdotally from my interactions with other scientists in the community. Thus, in the back of my mind, I qualify my reckoning with this disclaimer.</p>
<p>I've linked the topics to wikipedia so you can read further if you are inclined.</p>
<p>Framework to evaluate studies:</p>
<p>Selection Bias<br />
This refers to a bias in the way an experiment selects data or research subjects to study. Systematic biases are typically better than non-systematic ones. At least systematic biases are consistently applied.</p>
<p>Measurement Bias<br />
This refers to a bias in the way an experiment measures data. Sometimes an instrument may not be calibrated. Sometimes an instrument may be inappropriate for the research question at hand. Sometimes the units may not be apt.</p>
<p>Analysis Bias<br />
This refers to analyzing the data in an inappropriate manner. </p>
<p>Interpretation Bias<br />
This refers to interpreting an analysis in a manner that is biased towards a certain conclusion. One would imagine that industry science is rife with this type of bias.</p>
<p>Thinking about biases are a great way to start putting things into perspective, but there are a number of cookie-cutter scientific experiment designs that we see in the wild. These are worth knowing, or at least recognizing, as they each have their own strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate uses.</p>
<p>Types of Scientific Study Designs:<br />
In general, we start with a null hypothesis (assuming the thing we want to prove is NOT TRUE), and then go through the scientific process if the null hypothesis is false.</p>
<p>Case Report<br />
These are often seen in medical journals. These are merely reports about a special case a clinician has come across in practice and details the case.</p>
<p>Case-Control<br />
This is the simplest of scientific designs. There is a case, and a control. The two are put through identical processes and the results are analyzed to see if the null hypothesis has been disproved.</p>
<p>Cohort</p>
<p>RCT</p>
<p>Meta-Analysis</p>
<p>Exploratory Science:<br />
Exploratory science is a newer type of science. It is ever popular in the age of "big data". However, it also lends itself to erroneous conclusions if one is not mindful.</p>
