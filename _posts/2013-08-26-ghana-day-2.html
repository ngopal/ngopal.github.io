<p><span><span><span><span>I've started an album here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/44579186@N08/sets/72157635246859994</span></span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I awoke to roosters and birds. My little lizard friend (who I'm now calling Gerald) was there to greet me.</p>
<p>My breakfast this morning consisted of 3 pieces of toast, a cup of tea, an omelet, baked beans, and gizzards. Yes, I had gizzards (the digestive tract of a chicken I believe). It was chewy. Very chewy.</p>
<p>I started learning some Twi (the local language here). I can say a lot of the basic things (where I am from, who I am, how I am, asking, "how are you," etc.) I'll be doing this everyday for a week plus being immersed in the culture. I'm probably going to reach reasonable proficiency with this language! One of the more interesting parts of Ghanian culture is how they address others. A child interacting with his or her mother's friend would refer to her as "mother!" A woman interacting with her friend's child would also refer to the child as "son" or "daughter." The concept of aunt, uncle, or cousin doesn't really exist.</span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><br />

<span><span></span></span><br /><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span><br />We took a campus tour after the Twi lesson. Surprisingly large. The student life seems interesting. The book store had some great books. There were some interesting titles available such as, "How to Avoid Intimacy." The stats book were very interesting.</span></span><br /><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><br />

<p><span><span><br /></span></span><br />
<span><span></span></span><br /><span><span><br />We then ate lunch at a relatively high-end Ghanaian restaurant. Very tasty and things don't taste the way we would expect them to taste. Fufu was amazing (although what we have pictured here is tilapia).Â </span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><br />

<p><span><span><br /></span></span><br />
<span><span></span></span><br /><span><span><br />We all needed cellphones so we went shopping at a mall. Went to a street market and was almost roped into buying things I don't need yet. Not pushy, but good sellers. </p>
<p>In general, people are very friendly. Store owners REALLY enjoy to see me making an effort to learn and speak the local language. It seems like they suddenly stop viewing me as a tourist and view me as one of their own! Many even discount their goods--a nice perk, right?</p>
<p>However, I've realized that most Ghanians don't like getting their picture taken. Literally every place I've been to today enforces a "no photo" policy. The library (the university of Accra has the largest library in west Africa by the way) doesn't allow pictures. The grocery store doesn't allow pictures. Even the airport doesn't allow pictures.</p>
<p>Dinner wasn't too different from lunch. I essentially had fish again.</p>
<p>Gerald has decided to take the other bed. He has the right idea.</span></span></p>
