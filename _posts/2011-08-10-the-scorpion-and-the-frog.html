<div><span>An interesting story derived from eastern philosophy:</span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>One day a scorpion was trapped on the shore of a river, and he needed to get to the other side. </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>He asked a frog he saw swimming out in the water to come get him and take him across. The frog refused. </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>“You are a scorpion,” the frog said. “If I take you on my back, you’ll sting me.” </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>The scorpion said that was foolish, of course he wouldn’t sting him because then he would drown in the river and die, too. </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>The frog thought about it, and agreed that it wouldn’t make sense. </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>He let the scorpion on his back, and then started paddling across the river. When the frog was halfway out, the scorpion stung him. </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>As the frog was dying and they both began to slip under the water, he asked the scorpion why he did it. </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>“It’s my nature. I am a scorpion,” he said. “And scorpions <i>sting</i>.”</span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span><br /></span></div>
