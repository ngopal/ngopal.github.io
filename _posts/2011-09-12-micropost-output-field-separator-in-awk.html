<p><span>Awk has a nifty built-in variable users can overwrite called OFS. OFS stands for output field separator.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>Pretend I have a file which has 5 columns separated by single spaces, each of which I would like to print via AWK in tab-separated format.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span><u>Life without OFS:</u></span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span><i>cat file.txt | awk -F" " '{print $1"\t"$2"\t"$3"\t"$4"\t"$5}'</i></span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>Sticking a "\t" between each variable proves to be very annoying when scaled up.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span><u>Life with OFS:</u></span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span><i>cat file.txt | awk -F" " 'BEGIN{OFS="\t";}{print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5}'</i></span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>This seems a tad more reasonable. There is certainly less typing involved. The example I provided may not be the best use case, but it definitely shows the capability of OFS and where it can be useful.</span></p>
