<p><span><span>I've arrived in Ghana. My first impression is that this country is very similar to India, but much less chaotic. Unfortunately my power inverter seems to have died as soon as I plugged it in. The internet is also a little spotty.</span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><br />
<span><span>People are very friendly thus far. I definitely stick out like a sore thumb! Little lizards in the bathroom were here to greet me and all of the mosquitoes in the entire country seem to be vying for my attention!</span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><br />
<span><span>Early day tomorrow!</span></span></p>
