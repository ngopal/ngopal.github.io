<div>
<span>As someone who programs for a living, I spent a few months looking for ways to develop rockstar programming skills (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfgO-LXGpTM">like this guy</a>)--something that would give me an edge over the rest of the amazing programmers out there. </span></div>
<div>
<span><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span>Tools such as Vi/Emacs and the nifty shortcuts they offer only carried me so far. Really what I wanted was to be more productive. This translates to more functional code in less time. I wanted to design a program by mid-morning, code the core classes before noon, write wrappers and extensions after lunch, and wrap things up with a bow before the end of the afternoon.</span></div>
<div>
<span><br /></span><br /><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span><u>These four principles below are the secret:</u></span></span>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Learn to type more accurately</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Learn to type faster</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Find ways to type less</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Use IDEs whenever possible</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span>Although I hated to admit it at the time, I realized that I needed to work on two core computing skills--typing speed and typing accuracy.</span></div>
<div>
<span><br /></span><br /><span><u>Before I Started:</u></span><br /><span><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span>Before I started, I used this <a href="http://keybr.com/">tool</a> (which I have no affiliation with) to profile my typing speed. I clocked in at an embarrassing 40 words per minute with about 70% accuracy. This meant that I not only typed slowly, but was constantly hitting the backspace button to fix my blunders.</span></div>
<div>
<span><br /></span><br /><span><u>The Plan:</u></span><br /><span><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span>I decided to practice my typing for about 15 minutes every day (right before I quit using my computer for the day). My plan was to do this consistently everyday for eight weeks to see if I could feel a difference.</span></div>
<div>
<span><br /></span><br /><span><u>For Those Who Crave Immediate Gratification:</u></span><br /><span><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span>After three weeks, I noticed an increase in my productivity levels on the computer. Not just in terms of coding, but also in the speed of my email responses, the time in which I could put together a powerpoint presentation, and write detailed documentation. </span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>When I checked the metrics on the website again, I clocked in at 80 words per minute with 80% accuracy. This was 2X my stats two weeks go.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span>To Sum it all up, these four principles below are the secret:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Learn to type more accurately</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to type faster</span></li>
<li><span>Find ways to type less</span></li>
<li><span>Use IDEs whenever possible</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
