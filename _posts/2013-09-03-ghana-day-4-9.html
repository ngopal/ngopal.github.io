<p><span>This is going to be a combined post. I've been pretty busy for the<br />
past few days and my access to the internet has been intermittent:</span><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44579186@N08/sets/72157635246859994" target="_blank">http://www.<span>flickr</span>.com/<wbr></wbr>photos/44579186@N08/sets/<wbr></wbr>72157635246859994</a></span> <br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span>Day 4:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>We<br />
 went to a restaurant on campus called Tasty Treats. The food was<br />
awesome, but there were some interesting options none of us had ever<br />
tried before. We drew straws and someone in our group ended up eating a<br />
snail (which apparently tastes like chicken and has the consistency of<br />
octopus)!</span></li>
<li><span>People really are excited to see an "obruni" (Twi word<br />
 for foreigner) speaking the local language. I almost immediately get<br />
better treatment. When I bargain in Twi, I almost definitely get WAY<br />
better deals. At the same time, people are so happy to see it that they<br />
shake my hand and invite me to hang out with them.</span></li>
<li><span>We had a very<br />
 interesting conversation about what actually defines poverty and<br />
western paternalism. We unanimously agreed that a lack of money does not<br />
 equal poverty. However, we weren't sure that it was completely<br />
independent either. We ended up deciding that the primary measuring<br />
stick of poverty is a lack of opportunity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Day 5:</span>
<ul>
<li><span> The<br />
 judgement on the election results went smoothly. There were no riots<br />
and no one died (unlike what happened in Kenya). Everyone is counting<br />
their blessings. There was certainly tension in the air. Every white<br />
person in our group was getting shooed away when taking photographs for<br />
fear of being manipulated or misrepresented. This phenomenon seems to be<br />
 more prevalent in much poorer areas--our theory is that people are<br />
embarrassed to be on camera or that they think we are going to profit<br />
off of their poverty and want to be compensated).</span></li>
<li><span>The<br />
community here is surprisingly small. It's starting to get to the point<br />
where I can go to the mall, walk around on campus, or go downtown and<br />
see someone I've met before. What's even more amazing is that people<br />
remember me, when I dropped by, and what I bought or did!</span></li>
<li><span>I now<br />
have a fruit guy. I buy fruit exclusively from a 20-something year old<br />
guy from Togo. I tried to speak the local language with him and he said<br />
he didn't speak it! I tried Spanish but he didn't know that. His English<br />
 wasn't bad, but it wasn't his preferred language. We settled on French<br />
(which is surprisingly rare around here). The joke is that everyone<br />
around Ghana speaks French except for Ghanians, even the fish.</span></li>
<li><span>I<br />
 also learned about Ghanaian marriages. There is definitely a sense of<br />
tradition. Although people seem to go through the motions in a contrived<br />
 sort of way, it is the mode of operation here and people enjoy it. The<br />
man has to approach the girls parents and the parents have to act<br />
clueless. The parents have to then tell the girl there is someone<br />
interested in them and give her the choice of whether or not she wants<br />
to marry him. The man's family then comes to the girls house with tons<br />
of gifts to persuade the woman to join his family. Then a wedding is<br />
arranged. Water is of utmost importance in Ghanaian culture. When someone visits your home and you don't offer them water, it is considered an insult. Refusing the water someone offers you is an insult to the host (and likely means you are there for some sort of altercation).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Day 6:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>We<br />
 got to learn drumming and dancing from a man who is a graduate student<br />
in the School of Fine Arts here at the University of Ghana. We see women<br />
 carrying babies on their backs and working away. If a women with a baby<br />
 is making food and the baby is crying, she makes the food to the rhythm<br />
 of a song and calms the baby down while still working. Maternity leave<br />
is almost unheard of here.</span></li>
<li><span>I've been trying Ghanaian alcohol<br />
(although there aren't that many options). Many people are extremely<br />
religious and give me dirty looks when they seen foreigners drinking in<br />
their country. This may also account for why alcohol is so cheap<br />
here--there is minimal demand for it. We had a pretty good happy hour<br />
tonight.</span></li>
<li><span>There are a number of educated Ghanians (and other<br />
Africans from other countries too). Many people leave their country to<br />
learn English in Ghana. English is much more marketable than French or<br />
local languages. Since English is the official language of this country,<br />
 everyone can speak at least a little. A man with a small storefront I<br />
had a conversation with was fluent in Chinese. Another man had several<br />
family members in America (New Jersey to be exact) and chooses to live<br />
in Ghana because he likes it better. Other people were very open to<br />
sharing their stories and were very interested in hearing mine.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Day 7</span>
<ul>
<li><span>It seems that everyone here believes in some sort of a higher power. I've noticed that people become really uneasy when I don't have a solid reply for what religion I follow. Atheism is almost unheard of here.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Day 8</span>
<ul>
<li><span>MOTECH - Mobile Technology for Community Health</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>This is a very interesting company I visited and I hope they succeed. Many pregnant women in rural areas do not have access to the internet or medical professionals. Consequently, they tend to have a large number of miscarriages or high infant mortality. This company is setting up a system such that rural women and their family members can register for updates via their mobile phones. Pregnant women get an update every week about what they should be doing and what they should expect. Now, of course, this system comes with a number of challenges in cultural, financial, and technological contexts, but they are close to getting this idea off of the ground. They will go bankrupt if they don't obtain more funding by this next March--they have to show the Grameen and Bill and Melinda Gates foundations that they are making a significant difference here. I'm so proud to be able to help a company like this.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>GIFEC - Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communications</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>We also visited GIFEC (a governmental agency that funds programs in Ghana that helps the poor). People were nice, but many of the things they shared seemed very rosy.<br /> Suspiciously rosy.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span>Day 9</span>
<ul>
<li><span>We went to a major internet cafe called Busy Internet. A section of the building was for normal citizens who just want to Facebook or check email. Another area was reserved for people who brought their own computers but wanted wifi access. Yet another area is reserved for start-up companies and "soft business" incubation. The more serious business are provided space upstairs.</span></li>
<li><span>Esoko is a company that makes mobile phone apps for rural farmers. Farmers sometimes get ripped off on their produce and sell for too little. Other times they can't find a buyer. This app solves both problems for them.</span></li>
<li><span>I had my first encounter with Ghanaian gypsy children (who happened to speak Portuguese and English in addition to Twi, interestingly) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><br /></span><br />
<span>We leave for the Volta region tomorrow. And if internet connectivity wasn't hard to come by before, it certainly will be now... </span></p>
