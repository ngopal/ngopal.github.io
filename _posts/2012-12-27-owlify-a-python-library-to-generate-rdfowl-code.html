<b><span>Why Another Library?:</span></b><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span>I've been working with RDF/OWL data over the past few months. I've been moving away from high-performance databases and NoSQL and towards the semantic web. The semantic web allows us to represent rich, complex relationships between data--in ways we just aren't able to with current database technology. I've found RDF/OWL better suited for representing knowledge of the data I've been working with most recently.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<b><span>Libraries That Already Exist:</span></b><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span>We can query semantic web files with SPARQL. A Python library used to interface with SPARQL already exists. In fact, there is also a library that exists to help process RDF/OWL files in Python. However, I couldn't find anything well-suited to take a python object and transform that into RDF/OWL. So I wrote <a href="https://github.com/ngopal/OWLify">OWLify</a>.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<b><span>Explain <a href="https://github.com/ngopal/OWLify">OWLify</a>:</span></b><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span>In order to quickly turn my data into a RDF/OWL file, I wrote a bare minimal library I called <a href="https://github.com/ngopal/OWLify">OWLify</a>. I only included the functions I needed at the time. I'm putting it up on github for folks to fork and extend as needed. The interface is pretty simple. Creating new RDF-compliant functions should be very straightforward.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<b><span>Example Code:</span></b><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span>from OWLify import OWL</span><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span>names = ['Janet', 'Marcy', 'Ed']</span><br /><span>gender = ['Female', 'Female', 'Male']</span><br /><span>colors = ['Red','Blue','Green']</span><br /><span><br /></span><br />
<span>out = OWL('http://www.nikhilgopal.com', 'owl_example.owl', 'http://www.nikhilgopal.com/properties')</span><br /><span>out.start()</span><br /><span>for n in range(len(names)):</span><br /><span>    out.addClass(names[n])</span><br /><span>    out.assertEquivalentTriple(names[n], 'hasColor', colors[n])</span><br /><span>    out.assertSubClassTriple(names[n], 'hasGender', gender[n])</span><br /><span>out.end()</span><br /><span><br /></span><br />
