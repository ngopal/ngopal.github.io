Someone I know (who is an analyst at another company) recently shared a drink with me the other day, and he mentioned that he feels miserable in his data science job. 

Without sharing too many more specifics, his experience reminded me of two specific anti-patterns I've seen in regard to analytics-related work.

### 1. Data Science As An Insurance Policy
This is a scenario where you are asked to do some analytics or data science work to help "verify" a decision. The typical offender is a "decision-maker" of some sort. In my eyes, this basically amounts to an insurance policy for the decision-maker. 

When the analysis aligns with their decision, they have data to support their choice in the case that their decision didn't work out the way they expected.

When the analysis doesn't align with their decision, they can say that the data quality was poor, the analysis was faulty/inadequate, [insert reason here], etc. In short, they will dismiss the analysis as non-helpful.

*There is likely more than one remedy for this. My typical playbook is to ask about potential actions the decision-maker will make based on this analysis up front. If there is no measurable impact to the business, the analysis will likely be de-prioritized.*

In fact, this leads me to the second anti-pattern.

### 2. No Attribution for Insights
Imagine you did some excellent, excellent work on an analysis you were asked to do. In fact, some pivotal, positive business decisions were made as a result of that analysis. Will people remember you were the one that did that analysis 6 months later? To illustrate, have you heard the statistic that people have a 50% chance of developing Alzheimer's disease after age 85? Do you remember where that statistic came from?

My point is that the insight is more memorable than the source that generated it. To further complicate the situation, imagine that the decision-maker that used the information was vying for relevancy or trying to demonstrate business impact. Do you think they will offer credit where credit is due?

*My proposed remedy for this is asking for appropriate recognition, or doing talks around your company so people know who actually did the work and generated the insight.*

I think many analysts either will encounter, or have encountered these situations in the past. These are difficult situations, and hopefully these proposed remedies are helpful. If nothing else, know that you are not alone :-)
