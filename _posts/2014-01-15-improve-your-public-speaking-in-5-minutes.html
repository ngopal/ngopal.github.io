<p>Believe it or not, most people are actually great public speakers. They just don't know it yet. In my opinion, 90% of people could improve their presentations, speeches, and public speaking with ease.</p>
<blockquote><p>"During the Korean War, the Navy kill ratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down twelve of their jets for every one of ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to three-to-one. Our pilots depended on missiles. They lost their dog fighting skills." --<a href="http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Top-Gun.html" target="_blank">Viper, Top Gun</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In the same way Navy dog fighters started depending on missiles, too many presenters depend on PowerPoint. Personally, when I write a talk I try and design it so I could give the talk WITHOUT a PowerPoint presentation. People can focus on me instead of the slides. Plus, if we have technical difficulties, the show can go on!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Basic Rules:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. <strong>Draw long, calm breathes before starting to speak</strong>. In fact, do this for each sentence. Many people run out of breath because they want to say too much at once. Think of the air in your lungs as "speech fuel." You need to keep refilling the tank.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Project your voice</strong>. Throw it across the room. Don't yell, but pick someone across the hall and pretend you are talking to them face to face. You want your voice to "project" from you, to that spot a few feet in front of that special person you picked. Speak in a way so that your special person can hear you at normal volume. Speak from your chest, not your throat. Speaking from your throat not only makes you sound more high-pitched, but your voice will also give out faster.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Slow down</strong>. Most people tend to talk way too fast when under the spotlight. Even when you calm down and speak at what may seem like a slow pace, you are actually speaking at a normal pace to listeners. Speak any faster and they can't understand. Or you come off as nervous.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Use your body</strong>. Use your hands to animate your descriptions. People like energy! Don't overdo it, just make sure you don't come off like you are petrified on stage. Balance is the name of the game. Your poker face won't help you in a presentation.</p>
<p>Focus on improving just these 4 things and you will find that your skills are at the next level. Seriously.</p>

<p>Amy Cuddy, a psychologist from Princeton, gave aÂ <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html" target="_blank">TED talk</a> mentioning how strongly body language and emotions are tied to each other.</p>

<p>David Lee Roth, one of my favorite performers, mentioned in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxkY3fd5BY" target="_blank">interview</a> that he would try all kinds of crazy things on stage. He would fail half of the time, but it didn't matter--the audience would cheer just because he was so energetic and daring.</p>

Channel David Lee Roth's energy! Use these tips and avoid being awkward in front of large groups of people. As a closing note, videotape yourself. It's painful to watch yourself stumble, but you will identify your weak areas and know exactly how to get better. Good luck!</p>
