<p>The way this works is you look at the first number (which is 1 in this case), you say it out loud ("one 1"), and that becomes the second number in the sequence (11). Then we rinse and repeat--we look at 11, say it out loud ("two 1's"), and that becomes the next number in the sequence (21).</p>
<p>Here are the first ten:<br />
1<br />
11<br />
21<br />
1211<br />
111221<br />
312211<br />
13112221<br />
1113213211<br />
31131211131221<br />
13211311123113112211</p>
<p>The visualization you are looking at above is sequence number 25. The coordinates start at (0,0). Each number in the sequence is multiplied by (0,1) Up, (-1,0) left, (1,0) right, and (0,-1) down in turn. All of the coordinates are converted to absolute values so they trend from bottom left to top right on the canvas.</p>
