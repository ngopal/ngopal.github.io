<p>I've been wanting to experiment with MongoDB and NoSQL for a while now. I decided to load dbsnp data into a mongoDB database. It worked!</p>
<p>However, after learning more about the appropriate use cases of NoSQL and how they contrast with the appropriate use cases for SQL, I decided that I don't have any immediate applications I can incorporate MongoDB into just yet.</p>
<p>I've uploaded my code here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/ngopal/mongoDBsnp/">https://github.com/ngopal/mongoDBsnp/</a></p>
<p>You will, of course, need to download mongoDB from the mongoDB website.</p>
